# Hi!

I'm a rhetorician who theorizes about science and society. I enjoy playing with technology (old and new). My current interest is in open science and how it is changing the writing process. 

I'm a PhD candidate in NCSU's [CRDM](https://crdm.chass.ncsu.edu/), Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media, program.
