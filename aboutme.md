# Hi!

I'm a humanist who theorizes about science and society. I enjoy playing with technology (old and new). 

I'm currently a PhD candidate in NCSU's Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media program. 

When I'm not working on my dissertation, you can find me enjoying Raleigh's many parks, playing Pok√©mon GO, or chatting on IRC. 

If you'd like to follow my academic musings on twitter, my handle is [@laura_r0berts](https://twitter.com/laura_r0berts).

Below are my cats, Finny and Carrot.
